## Analysis of Interest Rate Control Policy in Japan
> Abstract: Since the zero interest rate policy was implemented in 1999, Japanese government has constantly made innovations and changed monetary policies as well as operational targets for more than 20 years. In this process, quantitative easing has been gradually upgraded and intensified. In the short term, however, Japan has failed to achieve its desired goal, aided by ultra-loose interest-rate controls. This has been questioned by many scholars around the world. By analyzing current situations of CPI and GDP in Japan over the past 20 years and establishing VAR model for empirical research, the results show that the effectiveness of Japan's interest rate control policy is insufficient and fails to achieve expected goal of restraining deflation and yen depreciation no matter in the short or long term. Based on Japan's experience and lessons, this paper provides suggestions for monetary policy making in other countries with similar situations.

## Time Series Analysis
- Analysis and forecast of China's tax revenue based on SARIMA model
> Abstract: This article uses the monthly total tax revenue of China's fiscal tax revenue from January 1990 to July 2021 as a sample. Through analysis, a seasonal model is established and it is found that the volatility of China's tax revenue obeys the GARCH process. On this basis, the fitting and prediction capabilities of various models were compared through parameter testing, stationarity testing, etc., and the SARIMA (0,1,1) (0,1,1) model and the volatility prediction model were obtained. The GARCH (1,1) model has the best fitting effect on China's tax revenue and is conducive to improving the accuracy of prediction. Based on the above model, relevant analysis was also conducted on my country’s tax revenue in the next year.

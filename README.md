## Analysis of Interest Rate Control Policy in Japan
- Abstract. Since the zero interest rate policy was implemented in 1999, Japanese government has constantly made innovations and changed monetary policies as well as operational targets for more than 20 years. In this process, quantitative easing has been gradually upgraded and intensified. In the short term, however, Japan has failed to achieve its desired goal, aided by ultra-loose interest-rate controls. This has been questioned by many scholars around the world. By analyzing current situations of CPI and GDP in Japan over the past 20 years and establishing VAR model for empirical research, the results show that the effectiveness of Japan's interest rate control policy is insufficient and fails to achieve expected goal of restraining deflation and yen depreciation no matter in the short or long term. Based on Japan's experience and lessons, this paper provides suggestions for monetary policy making in other countries with similar situations.
